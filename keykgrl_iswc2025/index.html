                        <p class="text">Knowledge graph representation learning (KGRL) aims to
                            convert entities and relations into feature vectors, thereby facilitating
                            their effective integration into contemporary AI models. This half-day 
                            tutorial explores the ongoing research avenues and key aspects being 
                            investigated in the latest KGRL research. In particular, this tutorial provides
                            a review of seminal works in KGRL from four different perspectives: (1)
                            KGRL methods incorporating multimodal data in generating knowledge
                            representations, (2) inductive KGRL methods that allow inference on
                            new KGs without retraining KGRL models, (3) KG foundation models
                            that pretrain a KGRL model using various KGs and apply it to different
                            KGs, and (4) representation learning methods on hyper-relational KGs
                            that extend the vanilla KGs to represent enriched information. Along
                            with four lecturing sessions, two hands-on exercise sessions will also be
                            provided, where audiences can run the KGRL methods and analyze the
                            results. As long as they have a basic background in machine learning and
                            non-trivial programming skills, all the materials will be easy to follow.</p>

                            <h4>Lecture 1: Knowledge Graph Embedding with Multimodal Data</h4>
                            <p class="text">While traditional KG embedding methods assume that only triplets are provided
                                and these are the only sources of computing KG embedding vectors, entities or
                                relations can accompany their textual descriptions. Additionally, entities can be
                                either discrete or numeric in real-world KGs, and sometimes entities or triplets
                                can be associated with visual features. This session discusses multimodal KG
                                embedding methods that integrate various visual, textual, or numerical data
                                into KG embedding vectors, enabling the embedding vectors to encode not only
                                the structural information of KGs but also the additional multimodal features.</p>

                            <h4>Lecture 2: Inductive Reasoning on Knowledge Graphs</h4>
                            <p class="text">Inductive KGRL methods allow a model to compute representations on a new
                                inference KG different from a training KG, enabling the prediction of missing
                                triplets on the inference KG consisting of new entities and relations appearing at
                                inference time. This is distinguished from a transductive learning setting, where
                                the entity and relation representation vectors are learned based on a fixed KG,
                                and only new combinations of them are considered for KG completion at inference time. 
                                This session discusses seminal works on inductive KGRL methods, with a particular emphasis 
                                on the core ideas and mechanisms they propose for enabling inductive reasoning over KGs.</p>

                            <p class="text">The inductive learning paradigm on KGRL leads to its extension to foundation
                                models. While inductive KGRL methods and KG foundation models share similar objectives in 
                                generalizing their abilities to unseen KGs, KG foundation models further extend these 
                                capabilities to arbitrary KGs. KG foundation models are pre-trained on diverse KGs and 
                                accommodate the varying underlying distributions across different KGs, allowing the model 
                                to be generalized to any KG. This session will cover recently proposed KG foundation models in the literature.</p>

                            <h4>Lecture 4: Representation Learning on Hyper-Relational KGs</h4>
                            <p class="text">Although KGs represent facts as triplets, this format often oversimplifies complex
                                information, motivating the extension to hyper-relational KGs (HKGs). In an
                                HKG, a triplet is extended to a hyper-relational fact, where a set of qualifiers
                                is attached to a triplet to represent auxiliary information, and a qualifier is a
                                pair of a relation and an entity. HKGs allow for a more flexible representation
                                of facts, with varying qualifiers as needed, to enrich information. On the other
                                hand, learning representations of entities and relations on HKGs becomes more
                                challenging due to the complicated structure between triplets and qualifiers, as
                                well as the entity-level, relation-level, and fact-level connectivities. This session
                                introduces the state-of-the-art HKG representation learning methods.</p>
